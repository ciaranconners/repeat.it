Repeat.io

The user-friendly flashcard app

Repeat.io is the new free web app that makes it easy for learners to create and review flashcards online, allowing you to study anywhere that you have access to a web browser.

Many popular flashcard apps require users to pay a fee for their services or download software in order create and review decks, making their use expensive or inconvenient. Additionally, other services don't offer the ability to create specialized cards for studying programming code snippets -- a feature that is useful for people studying various programming languages.

Repeat.io solves those problems by allowing users to sign-up and create decks for free, allowing those decks to be reviewed or edited within any standard web browser. Additionally, users can use "markdown" highlighting on flashcards to emulate programming code as it would normally appear on a user's screen.

"I used flashcard apps when I was studying Japanese, and had a wish list of features that I wished those apps offered during my studies," Repeat.io Product Owner James Quillin said. "That wish list of flashcard features that I couldn't find became longer when I was studying Javascript during my time at Hack Reactor, an intensive software engineering bootcamp. Repeat.io includes all of the features that I wanted in a flashcard app, and I hope it'll be useful for other students."

On your first visit to Repeat.io, create a user name and password and you'll automatically be logged into the site. Click "Create a new deck" to start making flashcards. After saving your deck, you'll see any decks that you create on the home page, where you can also choose to study, edit or delete existing decks. When you're finished studying, click "Log out" in the top right corner of the screen to end your session.

"Repeat.io has been very helpful for me as a coding bootcamp student -- especially since it fits into my budget and has features for coding that I couldn't find anywhere else. I use it every day," student Melissa Wilkins said.
